Bank Loan Prediction Console Application : 

This is a Python-based console application that uses machine learning to predict whether an individual is eligible for a bank loan based on specific financial and demographic data. The app reads data from a CSV file, processes it, and provides a prediction. It also includes a simple GUI built with tkinter.

Features
Machine Learning: Uses scikit-learn to predict loan eligibility based on input criteria.
Data Analysis: Processes and analyzes data from a CSV file with pandas and numpy.
Simple GUI: Provides a user-friendly interface using tkinter for easy interaction.
Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: The requirements.txt file should include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tkinter, and any other required libraries.

Usage
Run the main script from the console:

python loan_prediction.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to input relevant financial and demographic data.

View the prediction results in the console and GUI.
